## What is it?
---
Bubble Sort is an inefficient sorting alogrithm named for the way the smallest or
largest elements bubble to the top or bottom of the list (depending on
implementation). The algorithm steps through each element of the list, comparing
adjascent items and swapping them if they are not in the propper order. This is 
repeated until no swaps occur.

### Worst Case Performance = O(n^2)
