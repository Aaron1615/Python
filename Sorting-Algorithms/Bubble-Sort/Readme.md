# Bubble Sort
## What is it? 
Bubble Sort is an inefficient sorting algorithm named for the way the smallest or largest elements bubble to the top or bottom of the list (depending on implementation). The algorithm steps through each element of the list, comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are not in the proper order. This is repeated until no swaps occur.
