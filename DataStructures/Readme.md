# Learning Data Structures

### Introduction

The goal of this repository is to catalogue my process through learning Data Structures. Specifically, I am going through a textbook in order to teach myself proper implementations of basic and complex data structures in Python.

### Background

I am working through the following textbook: 

[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python] (https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)

My current knowledge of Data Structures is limited to the basics I learned through MITx 6.00.1x, 6.00.2x, Courseraâ€™s Principles of Computing, and further literature I have read.
